# <Your-Project-Title>

## Description

    The purpose of the project was to fix and simplify both the HTML and css of this webpage. It was originally not styled the way the client wanted and some of the links were broken. The CSS also had redundant sections so those have been removed as well. I have also added comments to each of the CSS sections so whoever looks at the code can easily decipher what each one does. The website  can be found at: https://sbarsuhn.github.io/Horiseon-Week-1-Project/ and a  screenshot of the full page can be found in ../assets/images/Horiseon.png
    

## Usage

    Click any of the categories in the navbar to jump to that section of the page.

## Features

This website eplains what search engine optimization, online reputation management, and social media marketing is. the style of the page is also easily adjustable by anyone even if they dont know how to code because every aspect of the style sheet is labeled so all someone would have to do is change the values of the element they want changed.
